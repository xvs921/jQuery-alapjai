<p>This paragraph party is so awesome!</p>
<p>I know, right? I'm having the time of my life!</p>
<p class="introvert">I'm glad you guys are having fun, but I'm kind of getting tired. I'd rather go home and read a book.</p>
<p class="introvert">Me too! Let's get out of here.</p>
<button>Take them home</button>

<script>
$(document).ready(function(){
  $("button").click(function(){
    $(".introvert").hide();
  });
}); 
</script>
